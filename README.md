Modelling Risk using GARCH and EVT

To run the code: evey script can be run independently by calling the ticker.py and giving the read function a ticker.
Code has scripts for GARCH, ARMA+GARCH, GARCH+EVT, Montecarlo and Histroical simaultaion. For our analysis we took three tickers S&P500 (^GSPC), DAX (GDAXI), PTY and then compare all the approaches.
